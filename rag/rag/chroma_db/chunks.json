The success of environmental legislations\nmainly depends on the way they are enforced. Legislation also serves as a valuable tool for\neducating masses about their responsibility in maintaining healthy environment.\nNumerous legislations have already been put forth at national and international levels. In\nthis lesson, you will learn about some important environmental legislations. Indian legislations\nare called Acts where as the international legislations are in the form of conventions, protocols\nand treaties.\n OBJECTIVES\nAfter completing this lesson, you will be able to:\n\u2022describe the constitutional pr ovision for envir onmental pr otection and\nconservation in India;\n\u2022list and describe the various Indian envir onmental laws along with their objectives;\n\u2022describe the various pollution r elated acts such as water , air and envir onment act;\n\u2022explain the various global conventions and their objectives in the field of\nenvir onment.\n 23.1 ENVIRONMENT AL LEGISLA TION\nThe genesis of various legislations in the country lies in the environmental problems.

An important aspect of environmental problems is that their impact is not confined\nto the source area but spills over far and wide area.\nEffective legislation is needed in order to prevent misuse and degradation of the environment.\nTo curb the destructive practices of unscrupulous people, forest mafia groups, poachers,\npolluters and over exploitation of environmental resources, ef fective legislation is necessary .\nPollution is an important factor and it does not observe political territories or legislative\njurisdictions.

So, to protect them from degradation the following\nacts have been passed.\n\u2022Water Acts\n\u2022Air Acts\n\u2022Environment Act\nA few important legislations of each category with brief description are given below:\n23.3.1 (i) The Water (Prevention and Contr ol of Pollution) Act of 1974 and\nAmendment, 1988\nThe main objective of this act is to provide prevention and control of water pollution and\nmaintaining or restoring of wholesomeness and purity of water (in the streams or wells or\non land). Some important provisions of this Act are given below:\n\u2022The Act vests regulatory authority in S tate Pollution Control Boards and empowers\nthese Boards to establish and enforce effluent standards  for factories discharging\npollutants into water bodies. A Central Pollution Control Board performs the same\nfunctions for Union Territories and formulate policies and coordinates activities of\ndifferent State Boards.\n\u2022The State Pollution Control Boards control sewage and industrial effluent discharges\nby approving, rejecting or impose conditions while granting consent to discharge.\n\u2022The Act grants power to the Board to ensure compliance with the Act by including the\npower of entry for examination, testing of equipment and other purposes and power\nto take the sample for the purpose of analysis of water from any stream or well or\nsample of any sewage or trade effluents.\n\u2022Prior to its amendment in 1988, enforcement under the Water Act was achieved through\ncriminal prosecutions initiated by the Boards, and through applications to magistrates\nfor injunctions to restrain polluters. The 1988 amendment strengthened the Act\u2019s\nimplementation the pollution provisions. Board may close a defaulting industrial plant\nor withdraw its supply of power or water by an administrative order; the penalties are\nmore stringent, and a citizen\u2019 s suit provision supports the enforcement machinery .\n(ii) The Water (Prevention and Contr ol of Pollution) Cess Act of 1977\nThe Water Cess Act was passed to generate financial resources to meet expenses of the\nCentral and S tate Pollution Boards. The Act creates economic incentives for pollution\ncontrol and requires local authorities and certain designated industries to pay a cess (tax)", "metadata": {"source": "23.pdf", "file_path": "23.pdf", "total_pages": 16, "document_type": "environmental_law", "chunk_id": "23.pdf_chunk_3", "chunk_index": 3, "total_chunks": 16}}, {"content": "--- Page 5 ---\n145Environmental Legislation\nNotesMODULE - 7\nEnvironmental\nManagementfor water ef fluent dischar ge.

Important provisions of this Act are given below:\n\u2022The Air Act\u2019s framework is similar to that of the Water Act of 1974. To enable an\nintegrated approach to environmental problems, the Air Act expanded the authority of\nthe central and state boards established under the Water Act, to include air pollution\ncontrol.\n\u2022States not having water pollution boards were required to set up air pollution boards.\n\u2022Under the Air Act, all industries operating within designated air pollution control areas\nmust obtain a \u201cconsent\u201d (permit) from the State Boards.\n\u2022The states are required to prescribe emission standards for industry and automobiles\nafter consulting the central board and noting its ambient air quality standards.\n\u2022Act granted power to the Board to ensure compliance with the Act including the\npower of entry for examination, testing of equipment and other purposes and power\nto take the sample for the purpose of analysis of air or emission from any chimney , fly\nash or dust or any other outlet in such a manner as may be prescribed.\n\u2022Prior to its amendment in 1987, the Air Act was enforced through mild court-\nadministered penalties on violations. The 1987 amendment strengthened the\nenforcement machinery and introduced stif fer penalties. Now , the boards may close\ndown a defaulting industrial plant or may stop its supply of electricity or water . A\nboard may also apply to the court to restrain emissions that exceed prescribed limits.\nNotably , the 1987 amendment introduced a citizen\u2019 s suit provision into the Air Act and\nextended the Act to include noise pollution.\n23.3.3 Envir onment Acts\nThe most important legislation in this category is The Environment (Protection) Act of\n1986.

The Wild Life Act provides\nfor state wildlife advisory boards, regulations for hunting wild animals and birds,\nestablishment of sanctuaries and national parks, regulations for trade in wild animals, animal\nproducts and trophies, and judicially imposed penalties for violating the Act. Harming\nendangered species listed in Schedule 1 of the Act is prohibited throughout India. Hunting\nspecies, like those requiring special protection (Schedule II), big game (Schedule III), and\nsmall game (Schedule IV), is regulated through licensing. A few species classified as vermin\n(Schedule V), may be hunted without restrictions. Wildlife wardens and their staf f administer\nthe act.\nAn amendment to the Act in 1982, introduced a provision permitting the capture and\ntransportation of wild animals for the scientific management of animal population.\nIndia is a signatory to the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of\nFauna and Flora (CITES, 1976). Under this convention, export or import of endangered\nspecies and their products are governed by the conditions and stipulations laid down\ntherein. Indian government has also started some conservation projects for individual\nendangered species like Hungal (1970), Lion (1972), Tiger (1973), Crocodiles (1974),\nBrown-antlered Deer (1981) and  Elephant (1991-92).\n(ii) The For est (Conservation) Act of 1980\nFirst Forest Act was enacted in 1927. This is one of the many surviving colonial legislations.\nIt was enacted to consolidate the law related to forest, the transit of forest produce and the\nduty livable on timber and other forest produce. Subsequently , the Forest (Conservation)\nAct was promulgated in 1980 to make certain reforms over the preceding Act of 1927.The\n1927 Act deals with the four categories of the forests, namely reserved forests, village\nforests, protected forests and private forests.\nA state may declare forestlands or waste lands as reserved forest and may sell the produce\nfrom these forests.

One of the major challenges is in adopting an instrument which helps realize\nthe objectives of equitable benefit sharing enshrined in the Convention. Towards this,\nlegislation on biodiversity was developed following an extensive consultative process. The\nlegislation aims at regulating access to biological resources so as to ensure equitable sharing\nof benefits arising from their use. The Biological Diversity Bill, which was introduced in the\nParliament on 15th May , 2000, was referred to the department related Parliamentary\nStanding Committee for Science, Technology , Environment and Forests for examination\nand report.\nAfter examination of witnesses and recording evidences, the Standing Committee approved\nthe Bill with some amendments. The Cabinet approved the proposal for moving the official\namendments based upon the recommendations of the Committee.

Most of the international legislations are international agreements to which\nnations adhere voluntarily . These agreements are generally finalized through international\nconventions or treaties. Nations that have agreed to be bound by the convention are\nknown as Parties. Convention provides a framework to be respected by each party ,\nwhich has to adopt its own national legislations to make sure that convention is implemented\nat national level. To support the conventions, some time protocols are also to be framed.\nA protocol is an international agreement that stands on its own but is linked to an\nexisting convention.  This means that the climate protocol shares the concerns and\nprinciples set out in the climate convention. It then builds on these by adding new\ncommitments-which are stronger and far more complex and detailed than those in the\nconvention.\n23.5.1 Wetland Convention (Ramsar  Convention)\nIt is an international convention came in force in 1975. The convention provides the\nframework for international cooperation for the conservation and wise use of wetland\nhabitats. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO)\nserves as the Depositary for the Convention, and its secretariat, the Ramsar Bureau, is in\nGland, Switzerland. India became signatory to this convention on in 1981.\nThe Convention aims to halt the loss of wetlands and to ensure the conservation of fauna\nand flora and their ecological processes. Obligations of parties include:\n\u2022designating one or more wetlands for inclusion in the list of Wetlands of International\nImportance (e.g. six Ramsar wetlands in India).\n\u2022promoting wise judicious use of wetlands, including mangroves.\n\u2022promoting conservation of wetlands through establishment of nature reserves.\n\u2022irrespective of their listing under the Convention and managing wetlands for the benefit\nof water fowl.\n\u2022promoting training in the field of wetland research, managing and warding.\n\u2022consulting with other parties about implementation of the convention, especially with\nregard to trans frontier wetlands, shared water systems, shared species, and\ndevelopment of wetland projects.\n23.5.2 Montreal Protocol\nThe United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has been addressing this issue\nsince 1977.

The convention provides for future protocols\nand specified procedures for amendment and dispute settlement.\nTo pursue the objectives of convention for the protection of ozone layer the Montreal\nProtocol  on Substances  that deplete the Ozone layer was agreed to  by nations in 1987\nand has since been amended five times so far . Its control  provisions were strengthened\nthrough five amendments to the Protocol adopted  in London (1990), Copenhagen (1992),\nVienna (1995), Montreal (1997) and Beijing (1999). The Protocol aims to reduce and\neventually eliminate the  emission of man-made ozone depleting substances.\nThe Vienna Convention and Montreal Protocol are considered as highly ef fective regime\nfor reducing and possibly , in the future, eliminating \u2013emissions of ozone depleting chemicals\ninto the atmosphere.\nThe Montreal Protocol uses three kinds of provisions as economic incentives to encourage\nparticipation and compliance with the Protocol\u2019 s control regime; (1) entry into force\nrequirements, (2) controls on trade with non-parties, and (3) research and technology\ntransfer benefits. The Protocol promotes technology transfer to developing countries, thereby\noffering economic incentives for developing countries to join and comply through a network\nof 507 monitoring stations located all over the country . Under the National Ambient Air\nQuality Monitoring Programme, 290 station covering over 90 cities/towns are being\nmonitored by the CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board).\n23.5.3 Climate Conventions\nGlobal warming (greenhouse effect) is probably the greatest threat to the future of the\nplanet. It is mainly caused by gases (gases like carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide,\nCFCs, water vapors) emitted by industrialized countries on the burning of fossil fuels\n(coal, oil and gas) for electricity , heating and transport. Because of gases that have been\nemitted in the past, and are still pouring into the atmosphere it is already too late to prevent\nsome climate change. However , if we start reducing emissions now , we may be able to\navoid some of the worst effects.\nToday , action occurs at every level to produce, to avoid, and to understand the risks\nassociated with climate change. Many nations have prepared national plans and are actively\npursuing programmes and policies that will result in green gas emission reduction. At the\nglobal level, countries, around the world have expressed a firm commitment stop climate\nchange and strengthen international action and broader participation under the auspices of\nthe UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\nUN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the landmark international\ntreaty unveiled at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio", "metadata": {"source": "23.pdf", "file_path": "23.pdf", "total_pages": 16, "document_type": "environmental_law", "chunk_id": "23.pdf_chunk_11", "chunk_index": 11, "total_chunks": 16}}, {"content": "--- Page 13 ---\n153Environmental Legislation\nNotesMODULE - 7\nEnvironmental\nManagementde Janeiro in June 1992.

In the 42nd amendment to the Constitution in 1976, provisions \nto this effect were incorporated in the Constitution of India with effect from 3rd Jan, 1977. In the \nDirective Principles of State Policy in Chapter IV of the Constitution, Article 48 -A was inserted \nwhich enjoins the State to make endeavour for protection and improvement of the environment \nand for safeguarding the forest and wild life of the country. Another landmark provision in \nrespect of environment was also inserted, by the same amendment, as one of the  Fundamental \nDuties of every citizen of India. This is the provision in Article 51 -A (g) of the Constitution. It \nstipulates that it shall be the duty of every citizen of India \u2018to protect and improve the natural \nenvironment including forests, lakes, rivers  and wild life and to have compassion for living \ncreatures\u2019.  \n \n2. There were provisions already existing in various enactments to tackle environmental \npollution. The Indian Penal Code, The Criminal Procedure Code, The Factories Act, The Indian \nForest Act, The Merchant Shipping Act, etc. have provisions for regulation and  legal action for \nsome specific environmental issues. However, with our country\u2019s emerging environmental \nscenario with industrialisation in the post -independence era, these were found either inadequate \nor being not effectively applicable to check the degra dation of our environment. After the \nStockholm Conference on Human Environment in June,1972, it was considered appropriate to \nhave uniform laws all over the country for broad environmental problems endangering the health \nand safety of our people as well as  of our flora and fauna. The Water (Prevention and Control of \nPollution) Act, 1974, is the first enactment by the Parliament in this direction. This is also the \nfirst specific and comprehensive legislation institutionalizing simultaneously the regulatory \nagencies for controlling water pollution. The Pollution Control Boards at the Centre and in the \nStates came into being in terms of this Act. Another related legislation enacted was the Water \n(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977 in order to c onserve this vital natural \nresource and to augment the finance of these regulatory agencies. Thereafter, The Air \n(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act was likewise enacted in the year 1981 and the task of \nimplementation of this legislation was also ent rusted to the same regulatory agencies created \nunder the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.  As the Water (Prevention and \nControl of Pollution) Act and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act were designed \nto deal with only wa ter and air pollution problems, it was in the year 1986 that the Parliament \nenacted a comprehensive or umbrella legislation for environment in its entirety. This is the \nEnvironment (Protection) Act, 1986. The responsibility for implementation of provisions  of the \nEnvironment (Protection) Act has to a large extent been entrusted to the same regulatory agencies \ncreated under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. Other agencies besides \nthe Central and State governments are  also entrusted w ith the responsibility of implementing \nspecific provisions of this Act and the Rules made thereunder depending on their operational \nrequirements.  \n \n3. Over the years, several amendments have also been made in the various existing statutes \nto meet the requireme nts of the unfolding environmental issues. The Indian Forests Act, The \nForests (Conservation) Act, The Factories Act, The Wild Life Protection Act, The Mines and \nMineral (Regulation and Development) Act, The Industrial Development and Regulation Act", "metadata": {"source": "7thEditionPollutionControlLawSeries2021.pdf", "file_path": "7thEditionPollutionControlLawSeries2021.pdf", "total_pages": 1270, "document_type": "environmental_law", "chunk_id": "7thEditionPollutionControlLawSeries2021.pdf_chunk_6", "chunk_index": 6, "total_chunks": 1204}}, {"content": "--- Page 9 ---\nviii \n and the Atomic Energy Act among others, have undergone such amendments. These Acts, being \nthe responsibility of agencies other than Pollution Control Boards for implementation are not of \nday-to- day concern for the Boards and, therefore, have not been covered in  the present volume \ndesigned for ready reference by the functionaries of the Boards and others concerned with them. \nThe size of the volume has also been consideration for the choice.  \n \n4. In this volume, and  effort has been made to compile the Acts and Rules c oncerning \nprotection and improvement of environment being implemented by the Environment \nMinistry/Departments as well as the Pollution Control Boards or the Pollution Control \nCommittees at the Central, State and Union Territory levels. The current volume i s the seventh \nedition of such a compilation of Acts and Rules by the Central Pollution Control Board. The first \nedition was brought out in the year 1989. Since the compilation of first edition, a number of \namendments have been made in the Acts and Rules an d new legislations have also been enacted, \nnamely, The Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991, The National Environmental Tribunal Act, \n1995 and The National Environment Appellate Authority Act, 1997. The Procedure for grant \nand renewal of licence for enviro nmental management system has also been included, though \nscheme is to be operated by the Bureau of Indian Standards. In the first edition, the Amendment \nActs were printed separately. This created some difficulties in having the updated version of the \nprovisions in one place, as it should be. In the present edition, amendments as on date have been \nincorporated in the respective principal Acts and Rules. Several Rules which have been framed \nto give effect to The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act , The Air (Prevention and \nControl of Pollution) Act , The Environment (Protection) Acts, 1986  and The National Green \nTribunal Act, etc. have also been included in this edition.  \n \n5.

Mehta vs. Union of India and \nothers in Supreme Court of India and Writ Petition 3381 of 1987 in the Bombay High Court;  \n \nAnd whereas the Honourable Supreme Court in its order dated 5 -12-1989 directed the Government \nof India in the M inistry of Environment and Forests to consider objection received in response to the \nNotification No. S.O. 852(E) dated the 7 th September, 1988 and take decision without having any \nobjection in respect of the fact that the matter is pending in that Court;  \n \nAnd whereas 138 objections were received which included 133 against and 5 for the prohibition;  \n \nAnd whereas 5 representations received in support of prohibition included suggestions by M/s \nMount Steward Tea Estate, Bombay to develop Antop Hill Warehousing  area into a semi wholesale Kirana \nMarket and not for storage of hazardous chemicals. The Save Bombay Committee cities  in appropriates \nof the complex in densely populated area and warned against the consequences of hazards in case of \nexplosion or accident.  The Institution of Industrial Managers India, the members of the Cooperative \nHousing Society Ltd. of th e Bank of India and the Bombay Environmental  Action Group have expressed \nthe same views. However, the Save Bombay Committee have no objection to the sto ring of non -hazardous \nchemicals;  \n \nAnd whereas of the 133 representations against the prohibition the institutional ones are from : \n \n(i) Secretary, Department of Environment, Government of  Maharashtra.  \n(ii) Antop Hill Warehousing Company Ltd., through its solicitors  (AHWC),  \n(iii) The Municipal Corporation of Greater  Bombay, \n(iv) The Indian Chemicals Manufacturers  Association,  \n(v) The Indian Merchants Chamber,  and \n(vi) The Chemical and Alkali Merchant  Association.  \n \nThe rest of the representations against the prohibition were by individual traders who have booked \noffices or godown space in the warehouse complex. The representations from the traders are similar in \nnature and cite financial loss and need for storage spa ces as the basis for opposing the notification. The \nmain thrust of the view of the Government of Maharashtra and the Municipal Corporation of the Greater \nBombay is that no environment pollution is likely by the storing of non -hazardous chemicals at Antop H ill \nWarehousing Company Limited (AHWC) complex. Such chemicals do not generate noxious gases or", "metadata": {"source": "7thEditionPollutionControlLawSeries2021.pdf", "file_path": "7thEditionPollutionControlLawSeries2021.pdf", "total_pages": 1270, "document_type": "environmental_law", "chunk_id": "7thEditionPollutionControlLawSeries2021.pdf_chunk_447", "chunk_index": 447, "total_chunks": 1204}}, {"content": "--- Page 471 ---\n411                               Notifications under the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986      \nliquids in any manner injurious to environment. It is also emphasized the instrumentation conditions have \nbeen envisaged for storage of chemicals and the licens e granted by the Municipal Corporation of Greater \nBombay to the AHWC will be conditional with safeguards  for safety. The AHWC gave the genesis of the \nWarehousing Complex at the Antop Hills and highlighted the various construction features like the \nelectrical fittings, fire protection features etc. The government of Maharashtra was anxious to remove the \nstorage of chemicals from the congested residential and commercial areas of the Bombay city measures \nprimarily to shift the chemical storage from Greater Bom bay which are highly congested and selected after \ndetailed studies conducted by the Government of Maharashtra and the Municipal Corporation of Greater \nBombay. The usual land reclamation investment had been undertaken by the Government of Maharashtra \nand the Municipal Corporation of the Greater Bombay during 1975 -79. The AHWC then obtained the \napproval of the Chief Fire Officer of the Municipal Corporation of the Greater Bombay, Chief Controller \nof Explosives, Government of India, Nagpur and other concerned authorities/ departments. The AHWC \nclaims that they have given the complete list of safety measures  incorporated in planning based on the \nstipulation imposed by the Chief Fire Officer and the Chief Controller of Explosives, Government of India \nin Write Pet ition No. 12179/85, namely, M.C. Mehta versus Union of India and others in the Supreme \nCourt of India. The AHWC also contested further that the storage is only for chemicals in their original \npacked condition and not meant for any bulk storage or repacking  or storing of any gases/carcinogenic \nsubstances or explosives and that the total quantity of chemicals to be stored in the complex at any one \ntime is not more than 5000 metric ton nes. Another main objection of AHWC was that the notification \ncould not be i ssued since the matter was subjudice in another Writ Petition No. 3381 of 1987 pending in \nBombay High Court. The Indian Chemical Manufacturers Association, the Indian Merchants Chamber \nand the Chemical and Alkali Merchant Association presented the same  arguments. \n \nAnd whereas it is difficult to conceive how the AHWC could ensure that only authorized chemicals \nwould be stored in the individual godowns . It is also not clear how the traders storing different types of \nchemicals needs segregation would manage to store all these chemicals in the godowns allotted to them. \nIn the pattern of trade in general and the chemical trade in particular the inherent na ture of a trader is to \nkeep his business information to himself. Considering that each business space for storage/office will be \nunder the individual control of each trader and no single body could take full responsibility for safe storage \nof chemicals by over a thousand individual firms dealing in different quantities of chemicals at different \nrates of turnover, different suppliers and widely varying terms of trade and methods of business, the \nAHWC or any other body will find it impossible to exercise comp lete control over the storage of chemicals \nbelonging to a large number of individual trades in t he same complex.  There is no safety system to control \nflammability, toxicity, corrosivity, reactivity, instability and oxidizing nature of several of the hazar dous \nchemicals. Public interest demands that under no circumstances should hazardous chemicals be allowed \nto be stored at the site in question;  \n \nAnd whereas the Government of Maharashtra appointed a committee headed by Dr. R.K. Garg to \nlook into the pros a nd cons of the use of Antop Hill Warehousing complex for the purpose of storage of \nhazardous and non -hazardous chemicals. The Committee has gone into all the detail and visited the site to \nconduct site inspection at length. The Committee has concluded, amo ng other things, that storage of \nhazardous chemicals at this site would make this storage a major hazard installation. The committee \nsuggested shifting of the storage of hazardous chemicals to a different site. The same Committee later \nprepared a list of c hemicals which could be stored in the proposed warehousing complex along with the \nquantities that could be stored. The 55 chemical listed by the Garg Committee in the context al ong with \npermissible quantity or storage are listed as per  Annexure;  \n \nAnd where as now all objections received have been duly considered by the Central Government;  \n \nNow, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by clause (d) of sub -rule (3) of rule 5 of the \nsaid rules, the Central Government hereby imposes prohibition and restri ctions that no hazardous \nchemicals as defined in clause (c) or rule 2 of the Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous", "metadata": {"source": "7thEditionPollutionControlLawSeries2021.pdf", "file_path": "7thEditionPollutionControlLawSeries2021.pdf", "total_pages": 1270, "document_type": "environmental_law", "chunk_id": "7thEditionPollutionControlLawSeries2021.pdf_chunk_448", "chunk_index": 448, "total_chunks": 1204}}, {"content": "--- Page 472 ---\nNotifications under the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986                               412  \nChemicals Rules, 1989, not being a chemical in the quantity mentioned in Annexure shall be stored in \nAntop Hill Warehousing Complex an d that the storage of approved chemical should be regulated in \naccordance with the recommendations of the Garg Committee.  \n \nANNEXURE  \n \nChemicals, with quantity that can be stored at the Warehousing Complex, Wadala  \n \n1.

It is also reported that in hill \nStates getting a stretch in river with area more than 5 hectare is very uncommon. So the size of lease \nfor minor minerals including river sand mining will be determined by the States as pe r their \ncircumstances.  \n \n(2) The mining of minor minerals is mostly in clusters. The Environment Impact Assessment or \nEnvironment Management Plan are required to be prepared for the entire cluster in order to capture \nall the possible externalities. These report s shall capture carrying capacity of the cluster, \ntransportation and related issues, replenishment and recharge issues, geo -hydrological study of the \ncluster area.  The Environment Impact Assessment or Environment Management Plan shall be \nprepared by the S tate or State nominated Agency or group of project proponents in the Cluster or \nthe project proponent in the cluster.  \n \n(3) There shall be one public consultation for entire cluster after which the final Environment Impact \nAssessment or Environment Management P lan report for the cluster shall be prepared.  \n \n(4) Environmental clearance shall be applied for and issued to the individual project proponent.

And whereas, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change deems it necessary to \nbring such projects and activities in compliance with the environmental laws at the earliest point of time, \nrather than leaving them unregulated and unchecked, which will be more damaging to the environment \nand in furtherance of this objective, the Government of India deems it essential to establish a process for \nappraisal of such cases of violation for prescribing adequate environ mental safeguards to entities and \nthe process should be such that it deters violation of provisions of Environment  Impact Assessment  \nNotification,  2006 and the pecuniary  benefit of violation and damage to environment  is adequately \ncompensated  for; \n \n12. And whereas, Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court in Indian Council for Enviro -Legal Action Vs. Union of \nIndia (the Bichhri village industrial pollution case), while delivering its judgment on 13th. February, \n1996, analyzed all the relevant provisions of law and concluded that damages may be recovered under \nthe provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 (1996 [3] SCC 212). The Hon\u2019ble Court \nobserved that \u2026\u2026 section 3 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 expressly empowers the Central \nGovernment [or its delegate, a s the case may be] to \"take all such measures as it deems  necessary  or \nexpedient  for the purpose of protecting  and improving  the quality of environment \". Section 5 clothes \nthe Central Government [or its delegate] with the power to issue directions for achieving the objects of \nthe Act. Read  with the wide definition  of \"environment\"  in Section 2 (a), Sections 3 and 5 clothe the \nCentral Government  with all such powers as are \"necessary or expedient for the purpose of protecting \nand improving the quality of the environment\". The Central Government is empowered to take all \nmeasures and issue all such directions as are called for the above purpose. In the present case, the said \npowers will include giving directions for the removal of sludge, for unde rtaking remedial measures and \nalso the power to impose the cost of remedial measures on the offending industry and utilize the amount  \nso recovered  for carrying out remedial measures Hon\u2019ble Court has further observed that levy of \ncosts required for carrying out remedial measures is implicit in Sections 3 and 5 which are couched in \nvery wide and expansive language. Sections 3 and 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, apart \nfrom other provisions of Water and Air Acts, empower the Government to make all  such directions and \ntake all such measures as are necessary or expedient for protecting and promoting the `environment', \nwhich expression has been defined in very wide and expansive terms in Section 2 (a) of the Environment \n(Protection) Act. This power in cludes the power to prohibit an activity, close an industry, direct to carry \nout remedial measures, and wherever necessary impose the cost of remedial measures upon the \noffending  industry. The question of liability of the respondents  to defray the costs of remedial \nmeasures can also be looked into from another angle, which has now come to be accepted universally \nas a sound principle, viz., the \"Polluter Pays\"  Principle.  \"The polluter pays principle demands that the \nfinancial costs of preventing  or remedying  damage caused by  pollution should lie with the undertakings  \nwhich cause the pollution,  or produce the goods which cause the pollution\u201d.  \n \n \n13 (1).

STANDARDS FOR DRY HEAT STERILIZATION  \n \nWaste sharps can be treated by dry heat sterilization  at a temperature not  less than 1850C, \nat least for a residence period of 150 minutes in each cycle, which sterilization period of 90 minutes. \nThere should be automatic recording system to monitor operating  parameters.  \n \n(i) Validation tes t for Shaprs sterilization unit  \n \nWaste shaprs sterilization unit should completely and consistently kill the biological \nindicator GeobacillusStearothermophillus or Bacillus Atropheausspoers using vials with at least \nlog106 spores per ml. The test shall be carried out once in three months  \n \n(ii) Routine test \n \nA chemical indicator strip or tape that changes colour when a certain temperature is \nreached can be used to verify that a specific temperature has been achieved. It may be necessary \nto use more than one strip  over the waste to ensure  that the inner content of  the sharps has been \nadequately  disinfected.  This test shall be performed  once in week and records in this regard shall \nbe maintained.  \n \n8. STANDARDS FOR LIQUID WASTE. - \n \n(1) The effluent generated or treated from  the premises of occupier or operator of a common \nbio medical waste treatment and disposal facility, before discharge into the sewer should conform \nto the following  limits- \n \nPARAMETERS  PERMISSIBLE  LIMITS  \npH 6.5-9.0 \nSuspended  solids 100 mg/l  \nOil and grease 10 mg/l \nBOD 30 mg/l \nCOD 250 mg/l  \nBio-assay test 90% survival of fish after 96 hours in 100%  effluent. \n \n1[\u201cNote\u2013 \n \n1.

\nNew Delhi, the 20 th February, 1991  \n \nG.S.R. 85(E ). \u2014 (1) The Government have decided to institute a Scheme on Labelling  of \nEnvironment Friendly Products. The scheme will operate on a nat ional basis and provide accredi tion and \nlabelling for household and other consumer products which meet certain environmental criteria along with \nquality requirements of the Indian Standards for that product. The Label shall be known as the \n\"ECOMARK\" and will be of the design to be notified.  \nAny product which is made, used or disposed of in a way that significantly reduces the ha rm it \nwould otherwise cause the environment could be considered as Environment Friendly Product.  \n \n(2) Objectives of the Scheme: \n \nThe specific objectives of the scheme are as follows: \u2014 \n \n(i) To provide an incentive for manufacturers and importers to reduce adverse \nenvironmental impact of  products. \n \n(ii) To reward genu ine initiatives by companies to reduce adverse environmental impact \nof their products. \n \n(iii) To assist consumers to become environmentally responsible in their daily lives by \nproviding information to take account  of environmental factors in their purchase  decisions.  \n \n(iv) To encourage citizens to purchase products which have less harmful environmental  \nimpacts. \n \n(v) Ultimately to improve the quality of the environment and to encourage the \nsustainable management of  resources. \n \n(3) Administrative and Organisational Structure \u2014 \n \nThere will be three stages leading to the award of the \"ECOMARK \u201d: \u2014 \n \n1. A steering committee , set up in the Ministry of Environment and Forests, to \ndetermine the product categories for coverage under the scheme and also formulate strategies for \npromotion, implementation, future development and improvements in the working of the  scheme. \n \n2. A technical committee, set up in the Central Pollution Control Board, to identify the \nspecific product to be selected and  the individual criteria to be adopted, including, wherever \npossible, inter -se priority between the criteria if there be more than  one. \n \n3. The Bureau of Indian Standards to assess and certify the products and draw up a \ncontract with the manufacturers, allowi ng the use of the label, on payment of a  fee. \n \n3.1.1 Steering Committee : \n \nA Steering Committee shall be set up in the Ministry of Environment and Forests by the Central \nGovernment to decide the product  categories to be taken up under the scheme, and to formulate  the \nstrategies for promotion, future development and improvement of this scheme.
